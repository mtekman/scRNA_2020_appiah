Some deliverables for co-authorship:


*** DONE 1. Perform DropEST analysis
    CLOSED: [2020-04-01 Mi 12:18]

    The aim was to create a dataset that would be compatible with =RNA Velocity=, and one method for this is to use the DropEST pipeline (which supports the CELseq2 protocol). This is what was performed in [[file:1_dropest.org][this notebook here]], but there was some uncertainty with quality of the cells to be produced. An alternative to RNA Velocity is the =scVelo= from the Theis Lab which is said to be just as good.
